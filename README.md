homework assignment 4

So I followed a TON of tutroirals online and really heavy focused on the math.floor(math.random()) aspect. Rather than creating if/else statements for every scenario, I used switch statements instead to save time. I think I need to greater understand what I'm doing as well as work on my my design aspect. A wrong turn I took was starting with strict code then design but for me, I should do the reverse since I am a visual learner. Lesson learned.

The goal of the game is to attack the opponent to get their HP down to zero. When either the player or enemy gets their opponent to zero, they win. Refresh to restart the game.

Errors I ran into:

Some characters when paired with certain enemeies wont run the program which is odd even though I have no bugs popping up in console.log.

Also when changing screens from chooing your hero to finding the opponent some design aspects are lost. I wanted the enemies vs. heroes to be side by side but I could not figure out how to get that design to work, unfortunately.
